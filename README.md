# README #

_**Ukufika**_ is a Raspberry Pi based IOT application that displays the bus arrival time and other information for the given bus stops in Singapore. It uses [Data Mall API](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html) from [Land Transport Authority (LTA), Singapore](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en.html).

## Components ##

* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) (any version is supported)
* [Waveshare 4.2inch e-Paper Display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4.2inch_e-Paper_Module)

## Technology ##

_**Ukufika**_ has been developed and tested in [Python 3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/). However, any Python 3x version is supported. 

## Setup ##

Follow the below table to connect the EPD display with the Raspberry Pi:
